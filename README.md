Awesome Flutter Snippets is a collection of commonly used Flutter classes and methods. It increases your speed of development by eliminating most of the boilerplate code associated with creating a widget. Widgets such as `StreamBuilder` and `SingleChildScrollView` can be created by typing the shortcut `streamBldr` and `singleChildSV` respectively.

## Features
- Speeds up development 
- Eliminates boilerplate 
- Supports complex widgets (Eg: Custom Clipper and Custom Paint)

| `layoutBldr`  | Layout Builder           | Similar to the `Builder` widget except that the framework calls the builder function at layout time and provides the parent widget's constraints.                                       |

| `strm`   | Stream  | A source of asynchronous data events. A stream can be of any data type. |
